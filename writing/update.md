# Status Update by Spencer H., Leah K., Till L., and Vanessa T.

Our project is coming along very well! Since our proposal, we have implemented
initial versions of several important classes, such as Actions, which stores
all the attacking/defending/healing methods, Character and Monster, which store
the objects for, well, characters and monsters, as well as methods to get and
set the various stats, and Utilities, which contains methods to allow us to
write more streamlined code in the main method by producing the more
frequently-used code bits, like the prompt to take an action. At this point, we
have a couple tasks left  before we have a finished game. First, we need to
fuse all the various classes into a working main method. Second, we need to
implement some test cases for our game. Finally, we need to determine what
aspects of our game we will performance test and just how we will assess their
performance. Our biggest stumbling block so far has been merge conflicts, but,
as a plus, weâ€™ve gotten very good at solving them on our own! Our team is
working well together and communicating both in the lab and on our private
Slack chat.
