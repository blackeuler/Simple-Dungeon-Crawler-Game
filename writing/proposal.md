Abstract:
DDCSA2B will be a turn based RPG dungeon crawler in which the player must battle
gnomes and other fantastic beasts and slay the great sorcerer Kapfhammer to save
Funky Kong.

Description:
Our final project will be a turn based RPG Dungeon Crawler. Character
information (stats, name, etc) will be stored in array lists as "character"
objects in order to make them accessible to the program and player as well as
dynamic. The program will move through three separate levels along with a final
boss. Each level will consist of one enemy and will progressively increase in
difficulty. The characters/players would have 3 choices of action: attack,
heal, and defend.

We will be creating test cases to make sure that characters are removed or
remain correctly after being interacted with as well as making sure that input
that does not fit prompts does not cause our code to crash.

The efficiency of the program will be focused on methods that pull random
values and run calculations. These will need to call character objects and
modify their values accordingly. There is also the possibility of measuring the
efficiency of players speed moving through the game.

Our end goal will be to add on story elements to make the game a more cohesive
and immersible experience.

Tasks: 
-Come up with a story/context for the game
- Consider character objects, what values they will have, how high to make
  them, etc.(stored in array list)
- consider opponent objects, their values, etc. (stored in array list)
- consider how long the game will be (how many times an encounter method would
  be repeated)
- Consider what the files will "look like" (e.g. one file with a simple main
  method, a file with character information, attack info)

Plan:
- Work and communicate effectively during allotted class time
- raise issues on github
- Think of how tasks can be divided up
- Set aside time outside of class to meet and work
